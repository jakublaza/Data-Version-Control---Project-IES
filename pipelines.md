# Pipelines
DVC allows to define a pipiline process. Such process include actions such as transforming our dataset, creating new fetures for our model or merging datasets. In a machine learning project that can be a complete workflow that include loading the data up untill running the model and producing some model assesment metrics. The flow of a pipelien is stored in a *yaml* file. The yaml file not only define the pipeline, but also decribes which data and commands to use, hence allowing for simple reproduction of a pipeline and its versioning. Further, DVC remembers which stages were already run and which needs to be run, so it prevents unnecessary reruns of parts of a code, thus making it efficient.
