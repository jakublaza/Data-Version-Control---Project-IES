# Data Version Control 
Data Version Control or DVC is an open source command line tool that builds on Git by allowing to track changes in large files, create lightweight pipelines and easily reproduce anyone's experiment. The DVC's added value is primarly used in Machine Learning projects.

Although, DVC can work independently of git, it is recommended to use with it as the framework and commands are similar to Git. Also, DVC has its extension to Visual Studio Code for a user-friendly manipulation.
