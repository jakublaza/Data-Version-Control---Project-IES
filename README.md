# Data Version Control 
Data Version Control or DVC is an open source command line tool that builds on Git by allowing to track changes in large files, create lightweight pipelines and easily reproduce anyone's experiment. The DVC's added value is primarly used in Machine Learning projects.

Although, DVC can work independently of git, it is recommended to use with it as the framework and commands are similar to Git. Also, DVC has its extension to Visual Studio Code for a user-friendly manipulation. 

### Why is DVC useful for ML Projects?
In a devlelopment of a large ML project the model and dataset usually changes. Without DVC it can be diffucult to know which specific version of dataset belogs to specific code or which code was used to produce specific model. DVC can version models as well as largefiles similarly to git, hence no more files names like *data_Final.csv*, *data_FINALFINAL2.csv* etc. and confusion about which dataset belongs to which code.
