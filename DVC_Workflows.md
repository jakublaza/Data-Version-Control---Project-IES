Git works well as a platform for the version control of codes. However, it faces some limitations when used for controlling the version of data and models. The reason is that internet hosting services like GitHub have a strictly limited capacity for uploaded files but the ML experiments typically need large-scale datasets, which might often change in the process of searching for a final model.
